Hyphenator
==========

Watson can tell you how tall Ke$ha is. It's time your computer can tell you how many syllables (roughly) are in a word, and fast!

Usage
-----

Hyphenator has one usage, phonetics. Primarily, this is useful for counting syllables quickly. But it could be used for other phonetic applications that need a speed up.

```bash
$ /path/to/hyphenator "WORDS I WANT TO HYPHENATE!"
> "WORDS I WANT TO HY-PHEN-ATE!" 
```
